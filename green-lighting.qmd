# Green-lighting process {#sec-greenlight}

All labs must complete a series of preparation steps, referred to by MB as the **"green-lighting" process**, before collecting data for any ManyBabies project. These steps are outlined in the [MB5 Lab Participation Overview](#sec-laboverview) list and in detail throughout the following sections of this manual, but in essence this involves:

-   providing **required documentation** (e.g., ethics approval, lab-specific Demographics Questionnaire)
-   demonstrating **correct implementation of the testing procedure**
-   submitting a **walkthrough video** of the lab's consent and testing procedure
-   sucessfully running pilot data through the **MB Data Validator**

#### IMPORTANT: 
<b><u>DO NOT</u> collect experimental data for MB5 until you have received a "green-light" from the MB5 Project Leads!</b>
