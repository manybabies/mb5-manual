### Thank you for contributing to {{< var link.mb5dotorg >}}, a project of {{< var link.mbdotorg >}}!

MB5 is a cross-lab effort to provide an empirical basis for discussions of replicability as well as cultural, developmental, and methodological variability in infant perception/cognition research. In this project, we are examining drivers of infants’ familiarity vs. novelty preference through a collaboratively-designed “best test” of a popular model of infants’ visual preference for familiar and novel stimuli [@hunter1988]. More details about the background, design and hypotheses can be found in the {{< var link.stage1rr >}} [@kosie]. In the following sections, we provide instructions for implementing the experiment in your lab and report data back to the project as a whole. Thanks for joining us!

## Manual Overview

This manual provides the information needed to participate in ManyBabies 5. The manual is divided into five sections ([General information](#sec-generalinfo), [Getting Started](#sec-gettingstarted), [Setting up the experiment](#sec-running), & [After data collection](#sec-aftercollection)). Each section is divided into chapters, which you can jump to using the navigation panel on the left of the screen.

If you find any errors or would like to suggest edits/improvements, you can let us know by creating an issue via the {{< var link.manualgithub >}} <i>(click on `Issues` then `New issue`)</i>. <br>
