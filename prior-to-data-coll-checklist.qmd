# Prior to data collection checklist

The steps for getting a "Green Light" to collect data are tracked by the MB5 Project Leads on the {{< var link.tracker >}}. You can check the tracker to see what steps your lab has completed. If you have any questions or think your lab’s progress is not up-to-date, {{< var email.emailus >}}.

As a reminder, **BEFORE BEGINNING DATA COLLECTION** your lab needs to:

-   Complete the {{< var link.signup >}} if your lab has not already done so
    -   *NOTE: if your lab does not appear in the* {{< var link.tracker >}}*, you still need to do this!*
-   Confirm demographics form is uploaded (see @sec-demographics)
-   Confirm ethics approval is uploaded (see @sec-ethics)
-   Confirm walkthrough video is uploaded (see @sec-walkthrough)
-   **Complete the Lab Questionnaire** THIS DOESN'T EXIST YET 
-   Validate dummy or pilot data using the {{< var link.validator >}} and upload validated data using the {{< var link.upload >}}
-   Send email to Project Leads ({{< var email.support >}}) to let us know that you are ready for "Geen-Lighting"

We may have questions for you (e.g., about any planned protocol deviations). We will do our best to respond quickly, but if you don’t hear from us within a week of sending the email, please contact us again!
