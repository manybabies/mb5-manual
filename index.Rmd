### Thank you for contributing to [**ManyBabies 5**](https://manybabies.org/MB5/) (MB5), a project of [**ManyBabies**](https://manybabies.org/)! 

MB5 is a cross-lab effort to provide an empirical basis for discussions of replicability as well as cultural, developmental, and methodological variability in infant perception/cognition research. In this project, we are examining drivers of infants’ familiarity vs. novelty preference through a collaboratively-designed “best test” of a popular model of infants’ visual preference for familiar and novel stimuli^[@hunterames]. More details about the background, design and hypotheses can be found in the [**Registered Report**](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/ck3vd). Below we provide instructions on how to implement the experiment in your lab and report data back to the project as a whole.
