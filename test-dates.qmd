# Data collection period

MB5 data collection is scheduled to run between the following dates:

#### *Start Date:* **2024-MM-DD** {.unnumbered}

#### *End Date:* **2025-MM-DD** {.unnumbered}

<br>

It is essential that all participating labs do their best to collect data prior to the End Date. However, we understand that there may be disruptions to data collection for various reasons.

**If you are having trouble meeting this deadline, please alert the leadership team ([mb5\@manybabies.org](mailto:mb5@manybabies.org)) as soon as possible to discuss options.**

<br>

**Labs may join the MB5 project any time during the data collection period, provided:**

-   they commit to completing data collection by the specified end date, AND
-   a formal “green-light” for testing is obtained from project leadership
