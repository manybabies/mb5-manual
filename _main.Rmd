# Overview {-}

![](images/mb-logo.png){width=30%}   ![](images/mb5-logo.png){width=30%}


Thank you for contributing to [**ManyBabies 5**](https://manybabies.org/MB5/) (MB5), a project of [**ManyBabies**](https://manybabies.org/), a cross-lab effort to provide an empirical basis for discussions of replicability as well as cultural, developmental, and methodological variability in infant perception/cognition research. In this project, we are examining drivers of infants’ familiarity vs. novelty preference through a collaboratively-designed “best test” of a popular model of infants’ visual preference for familiar and novel stimuli [@hunterames]. More details about the background, design and hypotheses can be found in the [**Registered Report**](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/ck3vd). Below we provide instructions on how to implement the experiment in your lab and report data back to the project as a whole.

# Getting Started

## Start and End Date
Data collection officially started XXX and will initially run until XXX. Labs may join the MB5 project any time during the data collection period, provided that set-up and a formal “green light” is obtained, and data collection can be completed before the end date. However, we understand that there may be disruptions to data collection for various reasons. If you are having trouble meeting this timeframe, please alert the leadership team to discuss possibilities.  

## Ethics approval
It is a good idea to get started on your ethics approvals as soon as possible. Approvals must be in place and a copy submitted to the Drive folder (see below) before you can obtain a green light to collect data. Contact us [mb5@manybabies.org](mailto:mb5@manybabies.org) if you need advice on obtaining ethics approval. 

MB5 and other ManyBabies projects ask labs to collect a number of [demographic background variables](ADD LINK TO PARTICIPANTS SECTION) to be made public along with the main data, e.g. parental education, sex, etcetera. Not all of those variables are part of the main analysis. Even so, it is highly relevant to collect them for follow-up and secondary analyses, and for checking the representativeness of the sample. Please contact us [mb5@manybabies.org](mailto:mb5@manybabies.org) if your ethics board raises concerns about collecting these data. 

##### Please make sure you have permission to publicly share anonymized raw data (including required demographic info), as this is a condition of participation. {-}


### Video sharing 
We strongly encourage labs (where possible) to store/share video recordings of their testing on [Databrary](https://nyu.databrary.org/), which is a secure site for this purpose. You will need to ensure that you have ethics approval in place to do this, and collect specific consent for this purpose from your participants. In addition, you will become a member of Databrary, which will require approval from your institution, so it’s helpful to start this process early. You can [begin the registration process for Databrary here](https://nyu.databrary.org/user/register?page=create). We are aware that many laboratories, particularly in the European Union, may not be allowed to use Databrary. In these circumstances we encourage labs to use alternative methods for sharing their videos where possible.

### Upload a copy of your ethics approval documentation 
Ethics documentation (e.g., IRB approval forms) should be submitted prior to data collection. Ethics forms should be uploaded using the [MB5 Documentation Upload Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTTmcQl1P1F4UWe95Jo7u5bken40AyAefXCYUJ9iYbnWaG8Q/viewform?usp=sf_link). **Please ensure that all materials uploaded for ethics are clearly labeled in the filename with your LabID (e.g. *babylabPrinceton_ethics.pdf*).** Check [here](https://manybabies.org/labids/) for a complete list of LabIDs to confirm yours before uploading. In some cases, labs will already have approval for MB5 under an “umbrella protocol” (i.e., a protocol that covers multiple studies in one lab). In these cases, the ethics form should still be uploaded as described here.


## Participants and Recruitment

### Age and numbers
The minimum expected contribution is a full sample of 32 babies (preferred, if possible) or a half sample of 16 babies between 3 months, 0 days and 15 months, 0 days old.

* Try to distribute participant ages across the full range of ages if possible
    * Please report the exact age in days. You can use an online tool such as: [https://www.calculator.net/age-calculator.html](https://www.calculator.net/age-calculator.html)
* In situations where labs planned but were unable to collect the minimum contribution, laboratory members will still be eligible for authorship. Alternative contributions may be requested by the Leadership Team in these circumstances.
* A lab’s sample size contribution includes any infant who enters the laboratory, even if they are eventually excluded (e.g., due to fussiness, experimenter error, etc).

While we encourage as much participation as you can spare, it is crucial to the success of the project that you treat our study with the same care as you would any other study in your lab with respect to recruitment procedures, timing of data collection, and RAs/RA training. Please do not commit to providing data to ManyBabies if this level of care is not possible.


### Eligibility and Exclusions
**The <u>only</u> requirements for inclusion in MB5 are that an infants’ age falls within the 3- to 15-month age range and that the infant has no known issues that would directly impede their ability to process visual stimuli.** Infants who are hard of hearing, premature, bilingual, etc can be included in the lab’s sample.

Please determine participants’ eligibility on the phone prior to scheduling them in the ManyBabies study to avoid testing ineligible participants, but note that the inclusion criteria for MB5 are much more inclusive than typical in-lab studies (described above). Participants who come into the lab who are subsequently determined to be ineligible should be reported in the sample.


### First-session/second-session policy
Some laboratories have the practice of testing babies in more than one study during the same visit. ***‘First session’*** refers to babies tested soon upon arrival to the lab, prior to participating in any other studies. ***‘Second session’*** refers to any testing that is done after the first session. 
* **Please contribute ‘first session’ babies when possible.** It is possible that second session babies will contribute worse/weaker/different data with respect to the larger goals of determining effect sizes. 
* **Please label ‘second session’ babies** appropriately if infants were run in a different study on the same visit prior to their participation in MB5. Please also document the nature of the study run prior to MB5 for all ‘second session’ participants (e.g., “7 minute study of object categorization using eye-tracking”).

# Setting up the experiment

Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book.

## Chapters and sub-chapters

There are two steps to cross-reference any heading:

1. Label the heading: `# Hello world {#nice-label}`. 
    - Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, `# Hello world` = `# Hello world {#hello-world}`.
    - To label an un-numbered heading, use: `# Hello world {-#nice-label}` or `{# Hello world .unnumbered}`.

1. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using `\@ref(nice-label)`; for example, please see Chapter \@ref(cross). 
    - If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: [any text you want can go here](#cross).

## Captioned figures and tables

Figures and tables *with captions* can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using `\@ref(fig:chunk-label)` and `\@ref(tab:chunk-label)`, respectively.

See Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig).

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.alt='Plot with connected points showing that vapor pressure of mercury increases exponentially as temperature increases.'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Don't miss Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(pressure, 10), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

# General Lab Practices

[note: this could maybe be a more comprehensive section that includes info about offline coding]

You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. 

Add a numbered part: `# (PART) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an unnumbered part: `# (PART\*) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: `# (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

# Prior to data collection checklist

## Footnotes

Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret `^[]`. Like this one ^[This is a footnote.]. 

## Citations

Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using `@key`.

For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015] (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). 
Note that the `.bib` files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML `bibliography` key.


The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: <https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations>

<!--chapter:end:04-prior-to-data-coll-checklist.Rmd-->

# During data collection

## Equations

Here is an equation.

\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation} 

You may refer to using `\@ref(eq:binom)`, like see Equation \@ref(eq:binom).


## Theorems and proofs

Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using `\@ref(thm:tri)`, for example, check out this smart theorem \@ref(thm:tri).

::: {.theorem #tri}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the *length* of the hypotenuse
and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the **other** two sides, we have
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

## Callout blocks


The R Markdown Cookbook provides more help on how to use custom blocks to design your own callouts: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html

<!--chapter:end:05-during-data-collection.Rmd-->

# After data collection

## Publishing

HTML books can be published online, see: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/publishing.html

## 404 pages

By default, users will be directed to a 404 page if they try to access a webpage that cannot be found. If you'd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a `_404.Rmd` or `_404.md` file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax.

## Metadata for sharing

Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the `index.Rmd` YAML. To setup, set the `url` for your book and the path to your `cover-image` file. Your book's `title` and `description` are also used.



This `gitbook` uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same.

Specify your book's source repository on GitHub using the `edit` key under the configuration options in the `_output.yml` file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter's source file. 

Read more about the features of this output format here:

https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/reference/gitbook.html

Or use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
?bookdown::gitbook
```
