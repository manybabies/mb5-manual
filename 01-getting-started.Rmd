# Getting Started

Welcome to ManyBabies 5! This section covers some basic aspects of the project that you'll need to know about BEFORE you set up and run the experiment. Use the arrows below to continue to through the sections, or jump to a section using the links.

## Green-lighting process
All labs must complete a series of preparation steps, referred to by MB as the **"green-lighting" process**, before collecting data for any ManyBabies project. These steps are outlined in the [MB5 Lab Checklist][MB5 Lab Checklist] and in detail throughout the following sections of this manual, but in essence this involves: 

* providing **required documentation** (e.g., ethics approval, lab-specific Demographics Questionnaire)
* demonstrating **correct implementation of the testing procedure** 
* submitting a **walkthrough video** of the lab's consent and testing procedure
* sucessfully running pilot data through the **MB Data Validator**

#### IMPORTANT: <u>DO NOT</u> collect experimental data for MB5 until you have received a "green-light" from the MB5 Project Leads! {-}



## Ethics approval
All data-collecting labs are required to obtain ethics approval from their local oversight board (e.g., IRB)^[If your lab/institution does not have a formal ethics oversight board, please refer to [MB's general ethics guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR2nv4Wy1soDS4cBBNy9QZOyewvvjP1ka1reBRhAIzcrNi0reJxgHuhGS7f7i2wE0ScQuppek8Al_21/pub) and contact the Project Leads to confirm ethics compliance]. As this process can take time, it is a good idea to **get started on your ethics approval application as soon as possible**. Approvals must be in place and a copy submitted via the process described below before you can obtain a green light to collect data. [Contact us](mailto:mb5@manybabies.org) if you need advice or help with obtaining ethics approval. 

> In some cases, labs will already have approval for MB5 under an “umbrella protocol” (i.e., a protocol that covers multiple studies in one lab). In these cases, the ethics form should still be uploaded as described below.

### Permission to collect/share demographic data
MB5 (and other ManyBabies projects) ask labs to collect a number of demographic background variables (e.g., gestational age, sex, parental education, community of descent) to be shared along with the main data (after full de-identification is confirmed) (see **[Demographics questionnaire](ADD LINK TO DEMOGRAPHICS QUESTIONNAIRE)** for all items). Not all of those variables are part of the main analysis. Even so, it is highly relevant to collect them for describing our sample, for follow-up and secondary analyses, and for checking the representativeness of the sample. 

##### Please make sure you have permission to publicly share anonymized raw data (including required demographic info), as this is a condition of participation. {-}
Contact us **[mb5@manybabies.org](mailto:mb5@manybabies.org)** if your ethics board raises concerns about collecting and/or sharing these data.


### Permission to share video recordings 
We strongly encourage labs (where possible) to store and share video recordings of their testing sessions on **[Databrary](https://nyu.databrary.org/)**, which is a secure site created for this purpose. Databrary allows for different levels of privacy: fully private (available only to the uploading research group), shared only with Databrary-approved researchers, or fully open. **You will need to ensure that you have ethics approval in place to upload and/or share recordings, and collect specific consent for this purpose from your participants' parents/guardians.** In addition, you will need to become a member of Databrary, which requires approval from your institution, so it’s helpful to start this process early. You can [begin the registration process for Databrary here](https://nyu.databrary.org/user/register?page=create). We are aware that many laboratories, particularly those based in the European Union, may not be allowed to use Databrary. In these circumstances we encourage labs to use alternative methods for sharing their videos where possible.


### Uploading ethics approval documentation {#ethics-upload}
Ethics documentation (e.g., proof of IRB approval) must be submitted to the MB5 leads prior to data collection. Submit your lab's ethics approval documentation using the **[MB5 Documentation Upload Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTTmcQl1P1F4UWe95Jo7u5bken40AyAefXCYUJ9iYbnWaG8Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)**. 

**Please ensure that all uploaded materials are clearly labeled in the filename with your LabID (e.g. *babylabPrinceton_ethics.pdf*).** Check the **[list of LabIDs](https://manybabies.org/labids/)** to confirm your lab's unique LabID before uploading. 



## Participants and recruitment

While we encourage as much participation as you can spare, it is crucial to the success of the project that you treat our study with the same care as you would any other study in your lab with respect to recruitment procedures, timing of data collection, and RAs/RA training. Please do not commit to providing data to ManyBabies if this level of care is not possible.


### Age and sample size
The expected lab contribution is a **full sample of 32 babies** (*preferred, if possible*) or a **half sample of 16 babies** (*minimum*).

##### *Minimum age:* 3 months, 0 days {-}
##### *Maximum age:* 15 months, 0 days {-}

> For example, on a testing date of 2025-04-15, eligible infants would have birthdays on or between 2024-01-15 and 2025-01-15. 
 
You can use an online tool such as this [Age Calculator](https://www.calculator.net/age-calculator.html) to use the infant's date of birth and testing date to determine eligibility and calculate age in days, which is the required format for age reporting.
<br>

##### Notes about age and sample size: {-}

* Try to distribute participants across the full range of ages, if possible.
* A lab’s sample size contribution **includes any infant who enters the laboratory**, even if they are eventually excluded (e.g., due to fussiness, experimenter error, too young or too old, etc.).
* In situations where labs plan but are unable to collect the minimum contribution (16 babies), lab members will still be eligible for authorship. Alternative contributions may be requested by the Project Leads in these circumstances.


### Eligibility and Exclusions
##### The <u>**only**</u> requirements for inclusion in MB5 are: {-}

* the infant's age falls within the 3- to 15-month age range AND
* the infant has no known issues that would directly impede their ability to process visual stimuli

**Infants with other characteristics that are commonly used as exclusion criteria in developmental studies (e.g., hard of hearing, premature, bilingual, etc.) can be included in the sample.**

Please determine participants’ eligibility on the phone prior to scheduling them in the ManyBabies study to avoid testing ineligible participants, but note that the inclusion criteria for MB5 are much more inclusive than typical in-lab studies (described above). Participants who come into the lab who are subsequently determined to be ineligible should be still reported in the sample but clearly marked as ineligible based on age or visual processing impairment (see [Data reporting guidelines][Data reporting guidelines] for more info).


### First-session/second-session policy
Some laboratories have the practice of testing babies in more than one study during the same visit. 

* ***‘First session’*** refers to babies tested soon upon arrival to the lab, prior to participating in any other studies.
* ***‘Second session’*** refers to any testing that is done after the first session. 

**Please contribute ‘first session’ babies when possible.** It is possible that second session babies will contribute worse/weaker/different data with respect to the larger goals of determining effect sizes. 

**Label ‘second session’ babies** appropriately if infants were run in a different study on the same visit prior to their participation in MB5. Please also document the nature of the study run prior to MB5 for all ‘second session’ participants (e.g., “7 minute study of object categorization using eye-tracking”).
