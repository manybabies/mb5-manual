In this project, we are examining drivers of infants’ familiarity vs. novelty preference through a collaboratively-designed “best test” of a popular model of infants’ visual preference for familiar and novel stimuli (Hunter and Ames 1988). More details about the background, design and hypotheses can be found in the Registered Report. Below we provide instructions on how to implement the experiment in your lab and report data back to the project as a whole.

Read this manual start to finish. BEFORE you begin data collection: Please ensure that you have carefully read the MB5 Collaboration Agreement and all of the documentation from the ManyBabies General Manual regarding ethical research, authorship, data sharing, and data use. Set up your study in consultation with this document. Carefully record any needed deviations from the protocol. Decide on your planned sample size/stopping rule. Complete the Laboratory Questionnaire [insert link], submit Ethics approval and other documentation/materials. Create and submit your walkthrough video. Run pilot sample through data validator. Send email to mb5@manybabies.org to let the leadership team know that you are ready for ‘greenlighting’. Wait for your official “greenlight” from the leadership team to begin data collection. Data collection: Collect your data! AFTER you finish data collection: Complete your participant and trial data files in consultation with the data reporting instructions [insert link]. Submit your data using the MB5 data upload form. IMPORTANT: DO NOT begin data collection (other than piloting) until you have been explicitly (and individually) “greenlighted” to do so.

There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 2.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter ??. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2024) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (xie2015?) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
