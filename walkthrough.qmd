# Walkthrough Videos {#walkthrough}

> Note: These instructions were adapted slightly from the MB1 & MB3 walkthrough instructions

Once the experiment is set up and people involved in data collection are trained and BEFORE beginning data collection, we ask that you document how you run the ManyBabies 5 study in your lab. Each lab is required to create a walkthrough video and submit it for approval. We strongly prefer videos, but if this is not possible for you, detailed photographs would be an option. **Even if you already provided a video for other ManyBabies projects, a new video, specifically showing how you run the studies of the MB5 project is requested.** 


## Purpose
The purpose walkthrough videos is two-fold: 
1. Given the ManyBabies Consortium’s commitment to Open Science, we would like to have a full and accurate record of how the study was implemented in each laboratory. 
2. One of the goals of ManyBabies is to study how methodological variation affects experimental outcomes in infant research. This video record may be used for analyses examining whether laboratories with different characteristics and procedures (e.g., larger or smaller test booths, white or black walls) differ in the effect size obtained in ManyBabies projects. 

Please rest assured that these videos will NOT be used by ManyBabies to critique individual researchers’ laboratory policies and procedures. This project is a community effort! 

## Method
There are two possibilities to create a video documenting your process:
1. Filming a (preferably pilot) session with a participant (with parental approval and permission from your local ethics board). **Please make sure you have permission to share this video fully publicly!!**
2. Asking a colleague to "play" parent and using a dummy (e.g., a doll) as a baby stand-in.

IF YOUR FINAL VERSION IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME, FEAR NOT. The goal is to be informative, not flawless - it can have starts and stops and disfluency.

## Consent
Note that we plan to share the videos among the consortium via Databrary, our website, and/or YouTube. There should be no assumption of privacy, and no confidential or otherwise sensitive information should be included in the videos. Be sure that parental consent covers all these options when filming participants. 

## Sequence
Make sure your video covers the following components. We added questions you should answer for each step.

### Greeting 
1. Where do you receive families? (Dedicated area, parking lot, general entrance)
2. Who is there? (Parents, colleagues, assistants)
3. What do you say and ask them? (Example: Do you check when the  baby last ate / slept?)
4. What do you do if a baby arrives asleep or fussy?

### Briefing before testing 
1. What instructions do you give to the parents? Are there any specific instructions on how to behave, sit, hold the baby, etc?
2. How detailed do you explain the procedure and aim?

### Informed consent
3. How do parents give consent?
4. When do you typically collect consent?

### Test
1. What does your testing room/booth look like (size, lay-out, etc.)? Try to film the entrance and complete interior of the test booth or room
2. Where is the baby sitting (e.g., parent's lap, high chair, etc.)? Film the seating arrangement before the baby is seating and with the baby 
3. What does the stimulus display look like (size, distance to baby)? Where are the screen(s)/lamps located? 4. Where is the experimenter located during testing (e.g., inside or outside the booth)? Show where the experimenter is sitting; if it is in the same room, capture both baby and experimenter. 
5. Can the baby see the experimenter during testing? How does the experimenter see the baby? (e.g.,videofeed)
6. If live-coding takes place: Show examples of what counts as a look / no look and/or videotape someone doing the coding together with the infant looks.
7. How is the experimenter blinded to trial type during testing?
8. Hos is the parent blinded during testing (blacked-out glasses or something similar)?

### Questionnaire(s) (when are they filled in / collected)
1. At what point do you hand out / collect questionnaires? 
2. Do you give any additional instructions?

### Debrief after experiment
1. What do you tell parents at the end of a study? 
2. Are there standard questions you ask them?

It is not necessary to narrate your video; a silent observer is sufficient, but be sure to cover all details requested above. If your lab language is not English, we might add subtitles later on.
